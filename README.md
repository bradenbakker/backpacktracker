## Description

backpacktracker is a simple app being developed by Braden Bakker for amalgamating information about your Daypack, Schoolbag, Expedition Pack or Luggage. 
It's tough to pack your bags, figure out if things will fit, or if you're going to get in trouble at the airport. That's why I wanted to make it a bit easier.
The app is in it's early stages, but it should be able to calculate the volume, weight, and value of your bag and it's goods. 
It also doubles as a handy packing list and record of your stuff in case it gets lost or stolen!

## The Stack
The app is built in React-native and is run on Expo. React-native apps are written in Javascript but are compiled to the native language of whatever device you're running it on i.e. Swift/Objective-C/Java

## To Set up the environment
1. Install git if you don't already have it. 
2. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Install [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/tools#cli)
4. Clone this repository
5. cd into the folder and run npm install

## To test the app
Install expo on your mobile device via your app store
### run expo start
Scan the barcode with expo (android only) or text/email the link to your phone


## Current Tasks
The app is very barebones right now, so here are some of the next things I'm working on, you're welcome to help me out if you like!
- Build out the Pack Page to take new items under Packs
- Separate the Pack creation Wizard into its own Component
- Add Settings support to limit the available fields
- Add styling to make the Packs look better
